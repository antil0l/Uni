wrote this script 
```Powershell
$mp3Files = Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Users\amir\Music" -Filter *.mp3 -Recurse

$randomFile = $mp3Files | Get-Random

Start-Process -FilePath "mpv.exe" -ArgumentList $randomFile.FullName, "--loop-file"
```
the loops are seamless now, tmw we start studying like a mother fucker, starting with physics
